/*
To solve this problem, you can use the Shoelace Formula to calculate the area of a triangle given its three vertices. The Shoelace Formula states that if the vertices of a triangle are (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), then the area (A) is given by:

A = 1/2∣x1⋅(y2−y3)+x2⋅(y3−y1)+x3⋅(y1−y2)∣

Now, to find the largest triangle area, you can iterate over all possible combinations of three points and calculate the area using the Shoelace Formula. Keep track of the maximum area encountered.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Initialize a variable maxArea to store the maximum area encountered, and set it to 0.

Iterate over all combinations of three points using three nested loops.

For each combination of three points, calculate the area using the Shoelace Formula.

Update maxArea if the calculated area is greater than the current maximum.

After iterating over all combinations, maxArea will contain the maximum area of a triangle formed by any three points.

Return maxArea.
