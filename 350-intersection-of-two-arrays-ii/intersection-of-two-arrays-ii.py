        Explanation:

length1 and length2 are calculated to store the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.

An empty list ans is initialized to store the intersection of the two arrays.

i and j are initialized to 0. These variables are used as indices to traverse the arrays.

The nums1 and nums2 arrays are sorted in ascending order using the sort method.

The main part of the code is a while loop that iterates while both i and j are within their respective array bounds (length1 and length2).

Inside the loop, the code checks the values at the current positions i and j in nums1 and nums2. Depending on the comparison, one of the following actions is taken:

If nums1[i] is less than nums2[j], it means the intersection should be later in nums1, so i is incremented.
If nums1[i] is greater than nums2[j], it means the intersection should be later in nums2, so j is incremented.
If nums1[i] is equal to nums2[j, it means they have a common element, so it's added to the ans list. Both i and j are incremented to continue searching for the next common elements.
Once the loop completes, the ans list contains the intersection of the two arrays.

The ans list is returned as the result.
