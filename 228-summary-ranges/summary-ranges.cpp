/*
This code does one main thing: it takes a list of numbers and finds consecutive groups of numbers. Then, it summarizes these groups and puts the results in a list. Here's how it works:

1. We start with an empty list called `result` that we'll fill with our summary ranges.

2. The code checks how many numbers are in the input list (`nums`). If there are no numbers (the list is empty), the code stops and gives us an empty list because there are no ranges to summarize.

3. We pick the first number in the list (`nums[0]`) and remember it as `a`. This is our starting point for finding ranges.

4. We use a "for loop" to go through all the numbers in the list one by one.

5. For each number, we check if it's one more than the previous number. If it is, we keep going because it's part of a range. If it's not, we've found the end of a range.

6. When we find the end of a range, we make a summary and add it to our `result` list. This summary tells us the start and end of the range. For example, if the range is from 3 to 5, we write "3->5."

7. After adding the summary, we update our starting point `a` to the next number because we'll look for the start of the next range.

8. We keep doing this until we've gone through all the numbers in the list.

9. When we're done with the loop, we might have one last range that we haven't added yet (the range ends at the last number in the list).

10. Finally, we return our `result` list, which now contains all the summary ranges.

In simple terms, this code finds groups of numbers that go one after the other and writes them down as a summary, like "3->5" for the numbers 3, 4, and 5. Then, it gives us a list of all these summaries.
